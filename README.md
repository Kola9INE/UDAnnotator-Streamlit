This is borne of the inspirational work done in https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Yoruba-YTB (a dependency treebank of 318 sentences from the bible and wikipedia sources).
The treebank was manually annotated. This project seeks to introduce a distributed and semi-automatic approach to to the creation of the dependency treebank. The result of this project is a webapp which can be used among distributed user in a community wide campaign to building or adding to a dependency treebank. The webapp is language-agnostic and intuitive. It can accommodate files in .conllu and .txt format and can also export files in .conllu and .txt format.

An experiment was taken to solidify the claim of the research from which this webapp is borne. See report at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395833304_YORDEPAN_TOWARDS_YORUBA_DEPENDENCY_TREEBANK_CREATION/
